This repository hosts all Accord Project models. Model's are captured using the [Concerto][concerto] modeling language; a platform and runtime neutral typed schema language.

The build system for this repository publishes the models to: https://models.accordproject.org

Environment Variables used by the build system:

- SERVER_ROOT : the root URL for the server. Used when generating absolute hyperlinks.
- FORCE_PUBLISH : disabled the download of external models and model validation. Should be used with care!
